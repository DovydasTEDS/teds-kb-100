## 12/29/2025 - Layout + Switches  

_Time spent: 3.0h_

First, I setup the required KiCad libraries / plugins. This involved installing the following repos:
[Zykrah's KiCad repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zykrah/zykrah-kicad-repository/main/repository.json)
[ebastler KiCad repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebastler/ebastler-KiCad-repository/main/repository.json)

From these repos, I installed the marbastlib library and the KiCad KLE placer plugin.

I then started placing down the switch matrix (22 columns, 6 rows). I then deleted the switches that weren't used, or areas where a switch was larger (e.g. enter, shift). After that, I started placing the PCB. After updating from the schematic, I placed the first switch and diode down in their correct positions. Using the KLE auto placer plugin, I was able to easily replicate this and place all of the other switches down, with the diodes in the same position. I then placed all of the stabilisers for all of the switches that were 2u or larger.

Summary:  
- Setup the environment
- Created the schematic for the switch matrix
- Placed switches in ISO 105 key layout
- Placed stabilisers

Todo:
- Wire everything
- Add leds (per switch)  

## 1/10/2026 10 AM - Connected switches (Schematic)  

_Time spent: 0.5h_

I connected all of the switches in the schematic in a matrix. I ended up with 6 rows and 20 columns. Unfortunately the pico only has 26 GPIO pins. I may need to use an IO expander.  

## 1/10/2026 3 PM - Duplex Matrix  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzk4MTgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--15aabb4406ff91f4f8e24832541255dd9a7fbb78/image.png)

Instead of an IO expander, I decided to add a duplex matrix. This involved merging 2 pairs of columns, halving the number of columns needed, but doubling the rows needed. Overall, this saved pins. I was also able to move some of the switches which were in a column alone to free up a column. This should remove the need for an IO expander. I looked into IO expanders, but felt they were too undocumented, both in QMK and ZMK. I am also considering whether I should add a rotary encoder or an oled screen, since I will only have 2 free GPIO pins after I add the backlight / rgb lights.  

## 1/11/2026 10:04 PM - Added RGB  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODExMTAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--8bb1b9fd620494e9a593a0903ede436dc453b379/image.png)

I added the RGB leds (sk6812mini-e) to the schematic and wired them up. I used 0.1uF capacitors to reduce the power consumption and that it wouldn't overload the pi. I connected the 5v to the VBUS / USB 5v power. Hopefully it works. Also wasted a bit of time due to bad counting.   

## 1/11/2026 10:24 PM - Fixed Capacitors  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODExMTgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--f217f92093e15789e729cc0c8011e09435b8bb32/image.png)

So turns out I don't know how capacitors work... At least I figured it out by doing some googling and wondering why mine looks very different to the others.  

## 1/12/2026 - Position all LEDs  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE1ODEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--c8bc795cff831acd9148b82378f6a612cf3b6d97/image.png)

I positioned all of the SK6812MINI-E LEDs and started wiring up the switches. But guess who forgot the capacitors... me. Hopefully all of the traces arent in the way of the capacitors.  

## 1/14/2026 - Capacitors + Connect rows + Columns  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI2OTYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--37049dee6cf162728fb7ef1e9fc9d74289e8e904/image.png)

I connected all of the rows and columns together (duplex so 2x rows and half columns). I placed the capacitors after which was a bad idea, but in the end it worked out. It was a lot of clicking and SHIFT + P. I used the (-7.4, 4) and (7.4, 6) offsets for the left and right capacitors. This is because I ended up flipping half of the LEDs to make data connections easier as it is in a Z pattern, going from left to right in the top row, right to left in the row below and so on.

## 1/16/2026 - Routed 5v + Capacitors  

_Time spent: 3.5h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODM5OTUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--8fbcb4f5433cb6aea49de8c2227b1cdc298f6322/image.png)

I routed all of the LED 5v pads to the capacitors, then connected the lines to a large 5v running throughout the board. The main 5v trace is thicker to prevent issues.
I also routed all of the columns, and started work on the rows and connecting the LEDs.  

## 1/17/2026 - Finished PCB (I think / hope)  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODQ2MzksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--5688d02682d415a8e8366ac54c1983726b2f864c/image.png)

Everything is routed. I routed the columns and rows to the Pi Pico. Was a struggle especially with all of the traces being packed together tightly. I then added a ground fill, and fixed any errors. I then added a silkscreen. I will now need to design a case, and also make the firmware.  

## 1/19/2026 - Added a level shifter.  

_Time spent: 0.2h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODYwMzQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--dc1946fd5843a21b0fa5225d72c672d16b04885b/image.png)

Why? Some guy in some random discord server told me to. Yep. That's it. I had a look around at different level shifters and figured out this one isn't too big and might not be too hard to solder.

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODYwMzUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--01d9e6e98a4a565dc8aab4ff3e6bec98fd0664aa/image.png)  

I was also given the advice to use a lower power LED but... I decided to stick with these. Resistors should make it fine and I can always limit it in QMK. I think.  

## 1/25/2026 12 PM - Created Keyboard Plate  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTA4NjEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--f145abd20fda4e7706094d28450bf4d479638070/image.png)

I used a generator to create the plate DXF. I added extra padding to ensure there is enough space and then added screw holes / tabs. I decided to go with a bottom mount instead of a tray mount.  

## 1/25/2026 4 PM - Created (mostly) bottom part of the case  

_Time spent: 2.5h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTEwNDQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--2f6a517c06c2011c99b96261495a8c6693e42318/image.png)

Using a sketch of the plate, I made the bottom case. I added a 1mm tolerence for the plate / case so that it would fit. I used an MX switch where the ESC key would be to align the plate and PCB. 

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTEwNDksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4a44b33cb001a0d57ccf808ce26bae8b2ae32fd7/image.png)

At first there was less clearance but then I added a bit more to make sure a USBC pico clone could fit (might use my RP2040 devboard that I made)  

## 1/25/2026 6 PM - Placed switches + Adapted plate to better fit rotary encoder  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

![Assembled](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTExNTIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--50d7bb522751969f762f5538a9761fa7138cc665/Assembled.png)

I placed every single MX switch into their spots. I used the measure tool and used move / copy along with coordinates to correctly place every single switch. I then edited the plate to add a square hole for the rotary encoder with a 0.5mm tolerance on all 4 sides.  

## 1/26/2026 - Redid plate + bottom placement / support  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTIyNTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--e522cf1b3cdf0a201222d709ab9308feb57f8da2/image.png)
I felt that the old plate + bottom case didn't support the case well and may break. As a result, I redid how it worked. Would've been quicker if fusion wasn't annoying and / or I did it from the start, but here I am. Time to work on the top part!  

## 1/27/2026 - Finished Top Case  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

![AssembledKB](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTMyNjksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--bdf02b494a42be6a738cc5e8cabb26ace7d0241c/AssembledKB.png)

I created the top case. First, I added screw holes to the bottom case. To do this, I had to adjust the mounting tabs to make enough space and to ensure it is strong enough.

Here is the top case:

I added space for an 18mm rotary encoder knob.

I also added some extra space for the tabs. 1.5mm extra so that a 3mm (1.5mm) acrylic plate could be used if needed, and an extra 3mm to make clearance for the M3 screws / bolts securing the plate to the bottom case.

I also added a tilt to the bottom of the case
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTMyODgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--95399c27e54926c58235f4e289060cf37091e683/image.png)

It should be around 5 degrees.

I also added a hole / slot for a USB cable (hopefully USBC if I can get a USBC RP2040 board)

I definitely didn't spend all day on this...
Time to get ready for the Design Review! (readme in repo, add cad files, bill of material etc.)
